## A long hiatus(?)

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
  <span style="font-family: Sans;">Before starting this post, I threw a casual glance at my old ones. Then I did a double-take.</span>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
  <span style="font-family: Sans;">Something was wrong.</span>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
  <span style="font-family: Sans;">The post content was all right, but something was very wrong with the dates. It must be a bug &#8211; some glitch in the blogging software that was causing this. Must be. because it said that my last post was on June 2011 &#8211; that’s almost two years back!</span>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;" align="LEFT">
  <span style="font-family: Sans;">That’s so impossible, it’s bordering on ridiculous. Admittedly, It’s been a rather busy time for me, but surely my writer-self (which I secretly take pride in so much) hasn’t been dormant for that long? Surely?</span>

It&#8217;s a thing that gets AT you, that nags at you &#8211; and haunts you &#8211; so that you&#8217;ve got, sooner or later, to make terms with it. And then, for a bit, you get some peace &#8211; until the whole thing starts over again.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;" align="LEFT">
  <span style="font-family: Sans;">When I read this quotation a few months back, it resonated with me so strongly that I immediately copied and shared it through facebook. But what about that nagging that Christie talked about? Why hasn’t it bothered me for the last twenty-four months? And if it did, why didn’t I resume writing?</span>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;" align="LEFT">
  <span style="font-family: Sans;">Looking back, I realize now what had happened. About two years back (a few days after I wrote my last post), I got heavily involved in a project that lasted more than eight months. Then a </span><span style="font-family: Sans;"><i>relatively less </i></span><span style="font-family: Sans;">hectic project for almost three months. Then I moved to a new city. Amid all these stress that I let build up for more than a year, my habit of regular writing took a hit.</span>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;" align="LEFT">
  <span style="font-family: Sans;">All those times, I was dependent on facebook to stay connected with my friends and relatives. Before long, I was regularly sharing news and articles that I found interesting, sometimes accompanied with my own thoughts. It wasn’t original content, but somehow I managed to convince myself that I am indeed ‘making terms’ with the nagging compulsiveness of writing.</span>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;" align="LEFT">
  <span style="font-family: Sans;">I did share some original stuff on facebook, but they were few and far between. By the inherent nature of status updates, they are limited in scope and short in length &#8211; several paragraphs at most. They cannot be called what I think of as </span><span style="font-family: Sans;"><i>real </i></span><span style="font-family: Sans;">writing. Which brings me to another issue: long-form writing.</span>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;" align="LEFT">
  <span style="font-family: Sans;">Earlier, in one of my blog posts, when I spoke about avoiding smileys, I was unknowingly referring to my preference towards long-form writing. For obvious reasons, I cannot hone my long-form writing skills through fb status updates &#8211; however original or frequent they might be.</span>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;" align="LEFT">
  <span style="font-family: Sans;">So now that I have noticed my long absence from my own blog and analysed the possible reasons behind it, I am making a promise to myself &#8211; to write regularly, and more importantly, to publish them on my blog. For now, the goal is to write/blog every week. I want to concentrate more on long-form writing, but that should not be an excuse for not posting regularly. (e.g. gap of a month to let the 3000-word article </span><span style="font-family: Sans;"><i>brew </i></span><span style="font-family: Sans;">nicely, and all such nonsense.)</span>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;" align="LEFT">
  <span style="font-family: Sans;">And finally, my dear Readers. we come to the conclusion of this post. The topic of this post was originally supposed to be something else entirely, but since I have forgotten what &#8211; I guess it wasn’t that important. In any case, it can always find its way to one of my future posts.</span>
