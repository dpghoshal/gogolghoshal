## What if I paid all your bills?

“*Yeah, right!*” you would say, rolling your eyes.

No, seriously. Give it a thought. I insist.

What if, hypothetically, I paid all your bills for the rest of your life? What would you do? What would you do for the rest of your life?

Think about it. Take your time, make up your mind, and then please let me know your answer in the comments section.

And please don’t copy/paste your bucket list. I am not asking for a list of events you want done before you die. I am asking you how you want to **live** your life.

Think hard.
