Gogol Ghoshal fancies himself as a writer (of [Bengali fiction](/bengali-fiction), mostly).

Gogol also likes to note down his random thoughts in his [blog](/archive).  
[You can follow [@gogolghoshal](https://twitter.com/gogolghoshal) or like [Gogol Ghoshal](https://www.facebook.com/GogolGhoshal) to hear about new posts.]

Gogol is a hardcore foodie and a cinephile. (He’s also a Quentin Tarantino fan, and has only pity for those who don’t like QT movies.)

Gogol is a tattoo aficionado. It is said that in a hypothetical prison war, he is most likely to join the gang with the craziest tattoos. <br>
[When asked for confirmation, Gogol refused to comment on this.]

Gogol tries to maintain a minimalist lifestyle.
Yes, that means he secretly gets a little annoyed every time someone gifts him something. <br>
[But if you still insist on giving him something, maybe a good ebook ([DRM-free](http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management), of course) is your best option.]

Gogol likes to think that someday he would have enough money to travel around the globe. <br><br>
